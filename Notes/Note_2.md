# Introduction to React

React is a JavaScript library used to build fast, interactive, and scalable user interfaces, especially Single Page Applications (SPAs). React applications update the UI without reloading the page.

**In simple words:**  
React helps us build modern websites where content changes dynamically without refreshing the browser.

## History of React

React was created by Jordan Walke, a software engineer at Facebook (Meta). It was first released in 2013. Today, React is maintained by Meta and a large open-source community.
